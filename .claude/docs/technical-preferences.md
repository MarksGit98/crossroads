# Technical Preferences

<!-- Populated by /setup-engine. Updated as the user makes decisions throughout development. -->
<!-- All agents reference this file for project-specific standards and conventions. -->

## Engine & Language

- **Engine**: Godot 4.6
- **Language**: GDScript (primary), C++ via GDExtension (performance-critical)
- **Rendering**: 2D (CanvasItem) — Vulkan/D3D12 backend
- **Physics**: Jolt (Godot 4.6 default)

## Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `PlayerController`)
- **Variables/functions**: snake_case (e.g., `move_speed`)
- **Signals**: snake_case past tense (e.g., `health_changed`)
- **Files**: snake_case matching class (e.g., `player_controller.gd`)
- **Scenes**: PascalCase matching root node (e.g., `PlayerController.tscn`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_HEALTH`)

## Performance Budgets

- **Target Framerate**: 60 fps
- **Frame Budget**: 16.6 ms
- **Draw Calls**: [TO BE CONFIGURED]
- **Memory Ceiling**: [TO BE CONFIGURED]

## Testing

- **Framework**: GUT (Godot Unit Test)
- **Minimum Coverage**: [TO BE CONFIGURED]
- **Required Tests**: Balance formulas, gameplay systems, hex math, pathfinding, LOS, guard cone
